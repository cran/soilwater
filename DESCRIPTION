Title: Implementation of Parametric Formulas for Soil Water Retention
        or Conductivity Curve
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Daniele Andreis, Fabio Zottele
Description: It implements parametric formulas of soil
    water retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten
    (for soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity)
    were implemented. 
    See reference (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_curve>).
